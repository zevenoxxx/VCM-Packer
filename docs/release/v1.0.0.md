This is a major stable release that brings significant improvements in core functionality, security, and user experience. We have worked hard to deliver a robust and efficient content management solution.

## üöÄ New Features

* **Full Folder Packaging**: Added robust support for encrypting and packaging entire directory structures, including all nested files and subfolders, into a single `.vcm` archive. This greatly simplifies content management for large projects.
* **Enhanced User Interface**: Significant UI/UX improvements to the Tkinter-based graphical interface for a more intuitive and smoother user experience. Buttons are more responsive, and input fields are clearer.
* **Operation Progress Display**: Introduced a progress bar and status messages to inform the user about the ongoing encryption/decryption operations, providing better feedback during long processes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes and Improvements

* **Memory Optimization**: Refactored internal data handling to significantly reduce memory consumption when processing very large files or folders, making the tool more efficient on systems with limited RAM.
* **Encryption Speed Boost**: Optimized the core encryption/decryption routines, resulting in up to a 20% increase in processing speed for typical file sizes.
* **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting and graceful handling of unexpected inputs or file system issues.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

* **Special Characters in Filenames**: Resolved an issue where files with special or non-ASCII characters in their filenames could not be correctly decrypted on some systems.
* **Password Input Validation**: Improved validation for password inputs to prevent common user errors and provide clearer feedback for invalid passwords.
* **Minor UI Glitches**: Fixed several minor graphical glitches and alignment issues across different screen resolutions.

## üì¢ Announcement

* **Support status:** Support for VCM Packer 2018 will end on October 25, 2025 because its security features are almost obsolete and not secure against advanced attacks. It is recommended that you use VCM Packer 2025 and keep it updated to stay safe from attacks and gain access to new features.
