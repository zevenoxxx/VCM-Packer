## üöÄ New Features

* **New Progress bar design**: The progress bar has been redesigned and improved. It also aligns with the process operation and accurately shows the progress. We are working on the progress bar to make it more accurate and optimized. You can view and develop the progress bar code in the source code of this tool.

* **Print the problem in html file format**: Now, whenever there is a problem with the tool or the encryption and decryption process, the details of the problem will be printed in an html file. You can open the html file and see how the problem occurred. (We recommend that you keep the html files as they will help you in troubleshooting. If you report a problem with the tool, it is recommended that you send the generated html file along with it so that we can better guide you.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes and Improvements

* **Memory Optimization**: Refactored internal data handling to significantly reduce memory consumption when processing very large files or folders, making the tool more efficient on systems with limited RAM.
* **Encryption Speed Boost**: Optimized the core encryption/decryption routines, resulting in up to a 20% increase in processing speed for typical file sizes.
* **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting and graceful handling of unexpected inputs or file system issues.

## üõë Known issues

* **UI Responsiveness:** During long pack or unpack operations, the UI may temporarily freeze or become unresponsive. This is due to the intensive nature of file processing and encryption that is performed on the main application thread.
* **Error Handling Feedback:** While initial error logging is available, more detailed error messages directly in the UI or in more comprehensive log files may be limited. Some errors may only appear in the console when executed from source code.
* **Progress Bar Performance:** In some scenarios, the progress bar update may not be completely smooth or may experience minor display glitches.
* **Multiple File Selection for Open:** Currently, only one `.vcm` file can be selected for open at a time.
 * **Cross-platform packaging:** Although the application runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, a `.vcm` file created on one operating system should generally be extractable on another, but extensive cross-platform compatibility testing is underway.
